# Step 0. Setting up Cloud Dev + Version Control Environment

Link Github repo with Google Cloud Build, so that we can leverage our GCP instance while doing version control on Github.

# Step 1. Data Collection

Perform data collection of both real and deep fake videos of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. For deep fake videos, utilize Presidential Deep Fake Dataset (https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/presidential-deepfakes-dataset/)

# Step 2. Fusion Model with Screenshots + Text

Follow the model architecture as laid out in the Midterm report.

It is a early fusion model that feeds in screenshots and transcripted text.
